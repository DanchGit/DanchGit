## **XR | Computer Vision | Colour Science**

I’m a **Computer Scientist specialising in XR, computational colour, and human perception**, with experience building and evaluating perception-based systems for AR/VR.  
My experience lies at the intersection of **colour pipelines, psychophysics, machine learning and XR**, supported by hands-on development in **Unity, Python, MATLAB and Blender**.

I also bring an industry foundation as a **Data Analyst at Bain & Company**, where I built reproducible analytical pipelines and worked in agile teams.

##  **A Bit More About Me**

When I’m not analysing colour perception or building XR experiments, I enjoy creating digital art, exploring new cities, and learning languages.
