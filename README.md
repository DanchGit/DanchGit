## **XR | Computer Vision | Colour Science**

I’m a **Computer Scientist specialising in XR, computational colour, and human perception**, with experience building and evaluating perception-based systems for AR/VR.  
My experience lies at the intersection of **colour pipelines, psychophysics, machine learning and XR**, supported by hands-on development in **Unity, Python, MATLAB and Blender**.

I also bring an industry foundation as a **Data Analyst at Bain & Company**, where I built reproducible analytical pipelines and worked in agile teams.

## **Selected Projects (XR / Vision / Colour)**

###  **Colour Characterisation for Optical See-Through AR (HoloLens 2)**  
Masters thesis project. Designed and conducted experiments to benchmark colour accuracy in optical see-through AR.  
Implemented characterisation pipelines, performed perceptual analysis, and trained deep learning models to improve robustness across lighting conditions, as well as background and observer differences.

###  **Foveated Rendering in VR (Varjo)**  
Implemented multiple levels of foveation and conducted a controlled psychophysical study to evaluate perceptual thresholds.  
Analysed performance–quality tradeoffs for real-time XR rendering.

###  **Detecting AI-Generated Art (DL + Fourier Analysis)**  
Built a curated dataset of AI and human-generated artworks.  
Implemented deep learning models using spatial and frequency-domain features, achieving **~98% accuracy** with emphasised model explainability.

###  **Colour & Translucency Perception (Eurographics, CIC)**  
Investigated and published 2 papers about how observers perceive colour differences in translucent 3D objects using psychophysics and ML analysis.

##  **A Bit More About Me**

When I’m not analysing colour perception or building XR experiments, I enjoy creating digital art, exploring new cities, and learning languages.
